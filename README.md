## Overview

Warden is a database migration manager  
Current status: __In development__  
Currently supported database: __PostgreSQL__

## Why yet another migration tool?

The idea behind Warden is not merely apply SQL scripts to databases, but also provide build tooling for those migrations, so they may be split into multiple files and that's easier to develop, maintain and reuse. That's somewhat similar to how you might want to separate concerns in source code of a project written in other (non-SQL) languages.
